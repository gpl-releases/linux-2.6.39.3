 * Description:
 *   This module provide extends netfilter feature to set a bitmask on a packets.
 *   In a difference from netfilter this masks lasts till packet leaves gateway TCP stack 
 *
 *   The module follows the Netfilter framework, called extended packet
 *   matching modules.
 * Usage :
 *  iptables -t mangle -I POSTROUTING 1 -o rndbr1 -p tcp --dport 6800:6866 -j GWMETA --gwmeta-gwmask 0x00000020
 *  iptables -t mangle -I OUTPUT 1 -o rndbr1 -p tcp --dport 6800:6866 -j GWMETA --gwmeta-gwmask 0x00000002
 *   Packet will have resulted ti_gw_meta ORed mask 0x22
