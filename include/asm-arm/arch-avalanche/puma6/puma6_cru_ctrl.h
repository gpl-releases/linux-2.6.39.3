/** \enum PAL_SYS_CRU_MODULE_T
    \brief  Enum for modules which can do Power an Reset
            management using CRU. Use these defines for all Pal
            APIs. CRU - Clock and Reset UNIT One per module (in
            some cases more than one) gate the clocks for power
            saving, and module reset controllability.
            The Output clocks from the pll's are connected to
            the CRU module which implemented clock gating and
            reset assertion for the IP modules.
